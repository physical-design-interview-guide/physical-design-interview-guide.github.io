<div class="about-page">

<h2>Hey There</h2>

<p>I'm a Physical Design Engineer with 10+ years of experience.</p>

<h2>Why this blog?</h2>

<p>This blog covers real Physical Design interview questions across every stage of the flow — Pre-PnR, Floorplan, Power Planning, Placement, CTS, Routing, STA, ECO, Signal Integrity, and Physical Verification. Every answer is written from practical experience, not just theory.</p>

<p>Whether you're a fresher preparing for your first interview or an experienced engineer brushing up before switching roles, this is the resource I wish I had when I was preparing.</p>

<p>That said, this is not to mug up question answeres but for freshers to learn, understand and it's quick revision for experienced people.</p>
